## Project 1: Building a Shiny web app
This aim of this project was to build a Shiny app which visualises and summarises metorological collected at 20 locations across the United Kingdom and to calculate and display a diagnostic called the Hutton Criteria which is used to alert farmers of the risk of potato blight forming on potato crops.
The app was required to have the following functionality:
- Allow the user to select up to five locations which should then be displayed on a map
- Allow the user to select one of four weather variables
- Allow the user to select the aggregation level of the data to be displayed
- Allow the user to select the time period to display
- Produce a variety of time series plots for the selected summary statistics.
- Display calculate and display the Hutton Criteria for a user selected location and month
